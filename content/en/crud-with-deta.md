One of the things that cost me the most to learn is databases, and for competitions like hackathons it is one of the things you can waste the most time on.

But a group of developers seeing these problems created a service called [Deta](https://deta.sh/) that simplifies the most essential tools in development to launch products in record time.

The platform includes a variety of features for simplifying the development process for free, including:

- [Deta Micros](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home/#deta-micros): A simple tool for deploy microservices written in Python or Javascript in the cloud for free.
- [Deta Base](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home/#deta-base): A simple NoSQL database service available in Javascript, Python and a API interface.
- [Deta Drive](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/drive/about): A simple file storage service available in Javascript, Python and a API interface.
